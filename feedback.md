âžœ ## Feedback

### Successes
* used a `.env` file - good practice.
* Code is readable and realatively well structured. 
* Attempted some sort or error handlung using `if` statments - ideally these would be `if/else` wrapped in a `try/catch` to be best practice. 
* Attempted to implement templating engine.
* Had foresight to abstract date to a function. Well done.
* commented about hacky approach - acknowledged. 

### Improvements
* no visible documentation/readme.
* nothing in `.gitignore`
* go with either ES5 or ES6 - there is a lot of mix'n'match
* Remove `console.log()`s and other redundant code that isn't actually working. If you need to 'keep' code that is a WIP (Work In Progress), then do so on seperate branch named for the feature/function.
* Hacky code is noted - a promise was created for the sleep, and comment made about implementing an async await => why not just do it using the inital promise with an additional `TimeOut`??
* use an actual id lib rather than a random number - this will return an id object. Best practice and also means that further down the line it will be useful. 

### Comments

There are a lot of positives here. Nice `app.js`, `main.js` could do witha  tidy up, in addition to clearing out some comments and unused code, however, some good code has been written. This is a really solid foundation to build on for the next projects. Hopefully there has been a lot of learning taking place this week. Well done team! :o)
